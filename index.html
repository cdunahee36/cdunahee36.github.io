<h2>The Lion</h2>

            <p>The Lion is a fierce animal. It has a large body, sharp claws, and strong jaws that can bite through bone and flesh like a razor.
                My favorite thing about the Lion, is that it is so quick and agile. If you were as fast as a lion you would be superhuman.

            <p>The Lion is a predator that hunts and kills, confidence and fearlessness are a few of the characteristics of the great animal.
                Defense is a big part of a Lion's life, they will defend there pride with their own life, which is very honorable.
